### VirtualEnv
1) *Why use it?*

So your projects don't cross wires (that is, package "wires")...

2) *Syntax*

```shell
$ virtualenv [options] <ENV>
```

3) *MVC Pattern*

	- Division of Concerns
	- Functional and Conceptual

	Model => Logic Between Controller and Data / Database
	Controller => Middleman between Model and Views
	Views => Presentation layer
